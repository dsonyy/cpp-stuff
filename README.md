# C/C++ stuff

## Recent projects

- **Angle visualization** - a small program which visualizes quaternion rotations in real time. It waits for a stream of floating point numbers on *stdin*. Each group of 4 floats represents a single quaternion (*qw, qx, qy, qz*). The program creates an additional thread which renders OpenGL window with a box, which will be rotated if new input is received. 

  Requires SFML 2.

## Old projects

C++ was the first programming language which I started to learn. I uploaded here some of my old projects and exercises which survived on my computer. I think most of them were created in 2016-2018. A few were also reviewed and fixed by me later.

- **Stephen Prata - C++ Primer Plus [Polish Edition]** - my completed exercises and examples from the book.
